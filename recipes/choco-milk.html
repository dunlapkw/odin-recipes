    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chocolate milk has been a staple in most modern lives, thanks to the ubiquitous nature of those little baby cartons served at schools and functions all the way up to the literal gallons some of our parents may have bought. The rest of us often had to make do with Hershey's syrup and regular milk (<em>which is no slouch in terms of flavor or texture, I assure you</em>), a powerhouse of a combination that kept kids like me happy for most of our lives.</p>
    <p>But this recipe? This ain't your momma's chocolate milk, not in a million years. This recipe involves a deep, dark secret ingredient that you're going to love. Are you ready to try it out? Here's what you need to get prepared.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>16 oz. whole, skim, or soy milk</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. chocolate syrup (or add to taste)</li>
        <li>ritual salt, cleansed by your local witch-doctor or cultist</li>
        <li>wolfsbane, or nightshade in a pinch</li>
        <li>6 freely-given souls, preferably extra-virgin</li>
        <li>1 ritual bowl, filled with the blood of the innocent</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the ritual bowl with the rites passed down by the forefathers, crowned may their heads remain.</li>
        <li>Moisten the rim of the ritual bowl and press it into the blessed salts to prevent any evil spirits coming into the blood.</li>
        <li>While the salt is settling and releasing the energy needed for purification, pour out the 16 oz. of milk into a flagon or glass and put the wolfsbane flowers gently at where the blood and bowl meet.</li>
        <ul><li>Note: You may hear screaming coming from the bowl. This is normal if you had to substitute nightshade as noted before. It will usually stop within two minutes. Also, under no circumstance should the wolfsbane or nightshade ever fully enter the blood.</li></ul>
        <li>Imbue the blood with the souls, which if you've performed the rites correctly, will wholly consume the wolfsbane and the blood and leave you with a dark brown liquid that no longer resembles blood. If it continues to look reddish or smell of iron, discard the ingredients and start again.</li>
        <li>Finally, mix the chocolate syrup and the milk first, blending to achieve the desired amount of chocolate. Then once you've done this, pour the dark brown liquid into the milk while chanting the names of the extra-virgin souls. They will enter into the drink, creating a small glow around the fringes and an aroma of birch.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>There you have it! Choco-milk, freshly made just for you! Hearty thanks to the blood, delicious thanks to the chocolate, and the best part is that you'll look twenty years younger after you're done.</p>
    <p>Trust me when I say this is the <strong>best</strong> way to have a recipe take you back to the good old days!</p>
