    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sometimes, the need for refreshment comes in different forms. For those who really like youthful fun, I wholly recommend our <a href="./choco-milk.html">Hearty Choco-Milk</a> recipe, as that one takes me back every time. But, for those of us with more refined palates (<em>and perhaps a less-than-stellar relationship with the forefathers</em>), there's always our Blended Onion Shake! Earthy and refreshing, this one will kick you in the face and leave you feeling both full and satisfied with the opportunities life has to offer. The ingredients are dead simple:</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 onion, peeled whole</li>
        <li>4 oz. milk or milk substitute (soy or cashew preferred)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Weep in the sadness that our forefathers have forsaken you while you fetch the blender.</li>
        <li>Place the onion into the blender along with the half-cup of milk. Blend well, making sure to pulse every so often to mix up the hard-to-see chunks. There's <strong>nothing</strong> worse than drinking one of these and having an onion chunk stick to the back of your throat.</li>
        <li>Once it's done blending, pour and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Make sure to enjoy this while it's fresh, as the water from the onions tends to leak out once it is blended and settles. My recommendation is always to have one of these while watching the rituals from your back porch in the hopes that you'll be selected once again.</p>
