For the recipes project from TOP

# I'm attempting this simple project as requested. We'll see how it goes!

Wish me luck!

## Note on recipes

Some of the content used in this project was shamelessly lifted from Google Images and recipe sites for the purposes of mocking up a web structure and drafting HTML for a project assigned by The Odin Project. None of these little babies will ever see production outside of this simple repository, and no theft of revenue or credit is implied, desired, or being attempted.

Shout out to that recipe for lasagna, though--it looked like it would have been fun to cook and eat!
